Changelogs will help us keep track of the _Public_, _Internal_, and _Technical_ changes to our project across the multiple branches over time.

They will get compiled into larger lists each time branches at the same level are merged into a target branch. These are just high level descriptions of the changes.  They do not discuss implementation details.

For now, we will use three types.
- Public - Changes that the player/client should be informed about.
  - i.e. new enemy types, updated controls, Public API changes, etc.
- Internal (Private) - Changes the development team should be aware of; this may include partners, testers, etc.
  - i.e. changing library dependencies, updating (physics, graphics, networking, etc.) systems, etc.
- Technical - Private API or other technical changes that developers and direct contributors (programmers, artists, and designers) should be aware of.
  - i.e. refactoring code, changing project organization,
